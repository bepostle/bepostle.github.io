# My Portfolio

As an operations professional with technical skills in CRM, business intelligence, and analytics, I chose Github pages as the tool to host my portfolio as it would require me to continue to build digital skills. I built this site from scratch using HTML and CSS, and embedded the work product materials from Google Drive.

Note: there are a few pieces that are still under construction as of September 2024. Please bear with me as I troubleshoot and resolve these items!

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Git

## Lessons Learned:

* It's inspired me to continue to produce high-quality work product now that I have a central place to showcase it
* Great refresher on technical skills like writing basic HTML and CSS, pushing to a Github respository from the terminal, and optimizing my IDE with add-ons like browser-refresh
