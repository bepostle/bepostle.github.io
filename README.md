# My Portfolio

As an operations professional with technical skills in business intelligence and analytics, I wanted to host my portfolio on GitHub to showcase my work product.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS

## Lessons Learned:

* Great refresher on technical skills, like pushing to a Github respository from the terminal, and optimizing my IDE with new add-ons like browser-refresh
* It's quite enjoyable to see an HTML and CSS webpage (or any tool) come to life as you're building it
